        <span>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci</span>
        >(15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High
        Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer,
        scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.[3] His

          Mona Lisa</a

        is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous
        painting.

        is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian
        Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, Salvator
        Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,[5] was sold at auction
        for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for the most expensive
        painting ever sold at public auction.

          measures 460 cm × 880 cm (180 in × 350 in) and covers an end wall of
          the dining hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan,
          Italy. The theme was a traditional one for refectories, although the
          room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it. The
          main church building was being completed (in 1498).
    
            Leonardo's patron, Ludovico Sforza, planned that the church should
            be remodeled as a family mausoleum, and to this end, changes were
            made, perhaps to plans by Bramante; these plans were not fully
            carried out, and a smaller mortuary chapel was constructed, adjacent
            to the cloister.[5]
